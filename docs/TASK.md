# Task Scenario: Secure Document Processing System

## Scenario Description

You are tasked with developing a Document Processing System for a fictional
company, **DocuSecure Inc.**, which handles sensitive documents. The system
should securely process and store documents and provide a user interface for
interacting with these documents. The requirements for the system will
implicitly cover various aspects such as multithreading, user authentication,
logging, and database interaction.

## Task Requirements

### 1. Document Upload and Processing

- Users should be able to upload documents through a web interface.
- The system should validate and process these documents asynchronously to
  handle large volumes.

### 2. User Management

- Implement user roles and permissions. For example, some users should only
  view documents, while others can edit and delete them.
- Ensure that document access is secure and that users must authenticate to
  interact with the system.

### 3. Audit Trail

- Maintain a log of all user actions (e.g., document uploads, edits, deletions).
- Provide a mechanism to search and view these logs for administrative purposes.

### 4. Document Storage and Search

- Store processed documents securely in a database.
- Implement a schema that allows efficient retrieval and management of documents.
- Include functionality to search through document content based on user queries.

### 5. External API Integration

- Integrate with a fictional external service to fetch metadata or additional
  information related to documents.

  ```json
  {
    "file_url": "string"
  }
  ```

- **Response:**

  ```json
  {
    "status": "string",

    "confidence": "float"
  }
  ```

### 5. Document Status

- **Endpoint:** `/documents/{document_id}/status`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Description:** Checks the processing status of a document.
- **Parameters:**

  - `document_id` (path): The ID of the document.

- **Response:**

  ```json
  {
    "document_id": "string",
    "status": "string",
    "last_updated": "string"
  }
  ```

## Additional Requirements

### 1. System Monitoring

- Implement monitoring for system performance and user activity.
- Ensure the system can handle concurrent document processing and user interactions.

### 2. Deployment

- Package the entire system in Docker containers and use Docker Compose to
  orchestrate them.
- Provide a detailed deployment guide.

### 3. Documentation

- Include comprehensive documentation on how to set up, use, and extend the system.
- Ensure that the code is well-commented and follows best practices.

## Implicit Requirements

- **Multithreading:** The system must handle concurrent document uploads and
  processing efficiently.
- **User Authentication:** Implement secure user login and role-based access
  controls.
- **Logging:** Create an audit trail for all user actions and system events.
- **Database Interaction:** Design a schema and manage document storage using
  an ORM.
- **PKI:** Secure document access and user authentication, potentially using
  public key infrastructure.
- **Search Capability:** Implement functionality to search through document
  content efficiently.
- **Caching (Optional):** Optimize document retrieval performance through
  caching.
- **Design Patterns:** Apply design patterns such as Factory for document
  processing and Singleton for logging management.
- **Unit Test:** Implement unit testing for the whole project.

---

This scenario implicitly requires the use of multithreading for handling
multiple documents, user authentication for secure access, logging for audit
trails, and database interaction with an ORM for storing documents. It also
implicitly demands considerations for secure document handling, efficient
content searching, monitoring, and optional caching for performance
optimization.

We encourage you to approach the task thoughtfully and to focus on delivering a
solution that reflects your experience and skills. We value clarity and
professionalism in all aspects of the process, including how you communicate
your technical knowledge.

**Note:** Using AI tools to write end-to-end structure is not allowed and will
disqualify you. Also, using external packages that implement the same function
is not allowed.
